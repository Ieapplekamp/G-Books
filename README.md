# G-Books

##### Deployed on Heroku: [Check it out!](https://g-books-ia.herokuapp.com/)

This app utilizes the Google Books API and places them on this webpage. Once you retrieve the list, you can either "View Book" or "Bookmark" it. If you choose to view the book, it will redirect you to that book's landing page on Google Play. If you click on the bookmark, you can save multiple(different) books, and access them later in the "Saved Books" page. It will also add them to your mongoDB. In the Saved Books landing page, you can view the book in the Google Books website or you can delete it from your saved queue.
